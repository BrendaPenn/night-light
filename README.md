UW MHCID Prototyping Studio Night Light Arduino 
By: Brenda Penn and Olga Khvan

Rapidly Prototype an interactive night light

Contains 3 RGB LEDs that are common anode. 
Uses a photocell resistor to control the brightness of the LEDs.
Uses a force senstive resistor to change the color of the LEDs.
